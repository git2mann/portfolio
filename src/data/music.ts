    description: `A sonic diary of incomplete ideas that found their voice. Across 16 tracks and 34 minutes, Klense weaves together alternative rock, jazz-tinged saxophone, alternative Hip-Hop, and ambient textures that feel both intimate and expansive.

This collection lives in the spaces between thoughts, where "The Evening Dispatch!" opens with urgent energy, "Saxophone" brings warmth to the chaos, and tracks like "Intermission IV" offer breathing room in the beautiful mess. Each song is a fragment that somehow feels complete, capturing those moments when your mind is everywhere and nowhere at once.`,
