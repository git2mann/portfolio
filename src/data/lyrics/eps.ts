      // Still Ultimate lyrics
      {
        lines: ["(Ultimate, I'm ultimate", "I'm ultimate, I'm ultimate", "I'm ultimate, I'm ultimate", "I'm ultimate, I'm-)","", "Ahh, you think I forgot, eh?", "Hahaha, nah! Nahh... I never forgot!","", "But here I am ladies and gentlemen", "I am just a human being like yourself", "If I have anything to you, it is for you to forgive me", "If you have done to me, I say it is for me to forgive you..."],
        explanation: "The track opens by sampling various sources, as well as a brief intro by Klense jokingly saying that he never forgot [about the original version of this song], and adapting words from Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first Prime Minister and President. These lines from Kenyatta's speech establish a tone of humanity and reconciliation. Rather than boasting, the artist begins by positioning himself as equal to the listener ('just a human being like yourself') and introduces themes of mutual forgiveness, setting up a reflective foundation before transitioning to more confident elements of the song.",
      },
      {
        lines: ["Ultimate! Ultimate!", "Ultimate! Ultimate!", "Ultimate! Ultimate!", "Ultimate! Ultimate!", "Ultimate! Ultimate!", "Ultimate! Ultimate!", "Ultimate! Ultimate!", "Ultimate! Ultimate!"],
        explanation: "This hook echoes Denzel Curry's viral track 'Ultimate' (2015), which similarly featured repetitive declarations of being 'ultimate.' By adopting this structure, Klense both pays homage to a recognized work in modern hip-hop while asserting his own claim to greatness. The repetition serves as both a hypnotic mantra and an amplification of the artist's confidence, building intensity before transitioning to the verses.",

          "To bein' roped into",
          "My ring and in a bout",
          "I'm so explosive",
        ],
        explanation: "Klense begins the verse by establishing the mental state he enters when performing, describing a fluid consciousness that allows for creative freedom. He then transitions to combat imagery, portraying his relationship with competitors through both violent metaphors ('slicin' mics') and sporting contests ('ring' and 'bout' suggesting boxing). The wordplay on 'explosive' characterizes his lyrical delivery as unpredictable and devastating, setting the aggressive tone for the track.",
      },

          "I roam in your path",
          "Bad omen, I'm back",
        ],
        explanation: "This section blends military imagery with writing metaphors. The reference to 'General Ike' (Eisenhower, WWII general and US President) connects military strategy with Klense's approach to battles on the mic. This ties in with another Klense song 'General Ike' (likely what Klense may be referring to here). The smoking pad metaphor suggests his writing is so intense it creates heat, while clarifying it's not from chemical stimulation but pure emotion. The final lines establish his return as an ominous event for opponents, with clever wordplay between 'roam/home' and 'omen/I'm back,' creating a sense of inevitable confrontation.",

          "Ali, while stingin' like bees",
          "Took a Boeing, I leave",
        ],
        explanation: "Klense continues the combat theme with 'black and blue' (bruising) opponents while comparing himself to predatory and dangerous animals. The puma represents stealth and power, while the hornet suggests aggression. The Muhammad Ali reference ('fly like a butterfly... stinging like bees') directly quotes the boxing legend's famous phrase, aligning Klense with perhaps the most renowned trash-talker in sports history. The wordplay on 'fly' transitions from movement to aviation with 'Boeing,' suggesting an elevated departure from competition - they're beneath him.",
      },

        lines: [
          "In a private jet",

          "Try n' try me!",
          "Make like Miley",
          "Hand 'em all standards",
        ],
        explanation: "This section transitions from physical movement to mental state, with luxury imagery (private jet, Maldives vacation) representing his mental elevation above others. The direct declaration 'I'm the best' shows unflinching confidence. The Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana reference works on multiple levels: 'Hand 'em all standards' plays on 'Hannah Montana' phonetically while suggesting he sets the bar for others. This pop culture reference also demonstrates his ability to blend different worlds into his lyrics while reinforcing the theme of dual identity (like Miley/Hannah) that appears later with other dualities.",
      },
      {
        lines: [
          "I know they can't quite reach",

          "Rest-assured a purp'll be pinin'",
          "If you knew what I mean",
        ],
        explanation: "Klense employs mock courtesy ('Where are my manners?') after asserting others can't match his level. The Bruce Banner/Hulk (Bruce and Bruisin') metaphor works brilliantly here - suggesting controlled power that becomes destructive when provoked. 'Get green' references the Hulk's color while possibly alluding to money/success. The wordplay on 'purple/people' in 'purp'll be pinin'' suggests his opponents suffer while also potentially referencing purple as a color associated with royalty, further establishing his self-proclaimed superiority. Klense takes this a step further as The Hulk (Bruce Banner) is often portrayed as being green in purple shorts.",

          "Nothin'",
          "That rap, that you were spittin' there's prolly wack",
        ],
        explanation: "This section escalates from natural forces (thunder/lightning) to cosmic significance. The James Webb Space Telescope reference (launched December 2021) is particularly timely, suggesting Klense's brilliance is visible across vast distances of space. The light metaphors (lightbeam, shining) contrast with earlier violence/combat imagery, positioning him as illuminating rather than just destroying. The verse then shifts to direct confrontation, dismissing competitors with 'probably wack,' while the 'on a track, stopping at nothing' line works as both a music reference and a declaration of his relentless approach.",

          "Now my life in a sentence's",
          "Been quite fulla signs that I'm",
        ],
        explanation: "This dense section contains multiple layers of wordplay. 'Cap' in modern slang means lie/fake, but Klense uses it to set up 'snap back' and 'fitted' - both types of hats and actions. Additionally, Klense continues the references to superheroes with 'Cap' as Captain America. The references to famous duos (Bonnie and Clyde, Jekyll and Hyde) suggest both his outlaw status and internal duality (A concept touched on in Avengers: Civil War, prominently featuring Captain America grapping with these themes). 'I'm my own competition' is a classic hip-hop boast that no one else is on his level. 'Life in a sentence' works as both prison metaphor and linguistic wordplay, suggesting his biography is condensed into his lyrics.",

          "Of a lack of progression!",
          "Man with a method",
          "I'm Batman",
        ],
        explanation: "Klense uses mechanical imagery (piston, engine) to describe his technical precision, comparing his rhythmic delivery to a finely-tuned machine. The 'transcend any fears of a lack of progression' line addresses artistic growth anxiety - a common concern for musicians releasing follow-up work. The Batman reference establishes him as both methodical and vigilante-like, operating outside normal constraints while maintaining strict personal discipline.",

          "Like lethal weapons when I-",
          "Clap back",
        ],
        explanation: "This section returns to the comeback theme with 'I'm back,' while 'spamming the effort' suggests overwhelming work ethic. Other MCs' negative reactions ('frown,' 'sullen expression') position Klense as disruptive to the status quo. The teaching metaphor establishes superiority, while 'Lethal Weapon' references the action film series, suggesting dangerous retaliatory capacity. 'Clap back' works both as slang for responding to criticism and as gunfire imagery, connecting to the Lethal Weapon reference.",

          "When I'm schemin' to settle this I'm-",
        ],
        explanation: "The final verse section contains three distinct pop culture references: Stranger Things (Eleven's telekinetic abilities with 'beam 'em' and 'Elevenin''), He-Man (the superhero with supernatural strength), and Venom (the Marvel symbiote character known for ruthlessness). This triple reference demonstrates Klense's ability to connect across different media universes while reinforcing his dangerous, superhuman persona. The verse intentionally cuts off mid-sentence to transition directly back to the hook, creating a circular structure that suggests perpetual dominance.",

        explanation: "The track ends with an extended repetition of the hook, driving home the central theme of unmatched excellence. The decision to end with the same phrase that dominated the intro creates perfect symmetry, encapsulating the track's message in a single repeated word. As mentioned earlier, this structure echoes Denzel Curry's 'Ultimate' while establishing Klense's own claim to the concept, the repetition functioning as both earworm and declaration.",

          "Face puffin' up"
        ],
        explanation: "The song opens with cosmic imagery reminiscent of Atlas holding the world, establishing the artist's godlike dominance. This celestial metaphor echoes similar themes in Kendrick Lamar's 'To Pimp A Butterfly' where control and perspective from above are recurrent motifs. The 'truth' reference connects to the track's exploration of authenticity while 'face puffin' up' captures a visual reaction to being confronted with uncomfortable realities—similar to how Eminem frequently describes opponents' physical reactions to his lyrics in tracks like 'Killshot' and 'Rap God.'"

          "Interviews"
        ],
        explanation: "The bird/moon comparison creates a David Attenborough-like nature documentary framing, suggesting the listener's bewilderment when faced with something celestially beyond reach. 'Ill repute' works triple-duty: suggesting negative reputation, showcasing technical skill ('ill' as excellence in the tradition of Nas' 'Illmatic'), and hinting at the artist's controversial position. The interview reference connects to the media ecosystem surrounding artists, reminiscent of Kanye West's complicated relationship with press portrayal as explored in 'I Am A God' and various public statements about media representation."

        explanation: "This quadruple entendre connects 'interviews/inner views/in-between views/interludes,' blending media critique with artistic authenticity. The wordplay technique recalls MF DOOM's intricate linguistic constructions. 'See it through' references artistic integrity similar to J. Cole's 'Middle Child' philosophy of maintaining vision despite commercial pressures. The concept of 'inner views' also mirrors Frank Ocean's approach in 'Blonde' where personal perspective transcends conventional narrative, suggesting Klense values authentic expression over traditional interview formats."

        explanation: "The wrestling imagery ('pinnin' you') invokes both physical dominance and the WWE entertainment factor of performative combat—a metaphor The Rock often used when transitioning between wrestling and rap culture. The 'itchin'' suggests eager anticipation while creating near-rhymes with 'pinnin'' and 'seein'', demonstrating the technical prowess of artists like Black Thought. 'Seein' through' plays with transparency motifs found throughout Jay-Z's '4:44' album where vulnerability and revelation become strength. 'Lyrics too' suggests meta-awareness of his own writing process, similar to Aesop Rock's self-referential style in 'Labor Days.'"

        ],
        explanation: "The juxtaposition of scientific methodology ('empirical') with artistic expression creates intellectual tension similar to GZA's approach in 'Liquid Swords'. This scientifically-informed lyrical philosophy connects to contemporaries like Lupe Fiasco who frequently incorporate academic concepts. The King Kong reference does triple duty: invoking the iconic monster's size, suggesting breaking through limitations ('ceiling'), and possibly alluding to the racialized aspects of the Kong narrative as examined in academic works like Cynthia Erb's 'Tracking King Kong.' This multidimensional reference technique mirrors the layered cultural analysis in Childish Gambino's 'This Is America.'"

        ],
        explanation: "The Godzilla reference builds on the previous monster imagery while adding Japanese pop culture connections—potentially nodding to Foreign Exchange's international influences. The unlikely setting ('barn/chicken coup') creates surreal juxtaposition reminiscent of Outkast's 'ATLiens' where familiar and alien elements collide. The wordplay on 'coup/coop' demonstrates political awareness similar to Dead Prez or Public Enemy, while 'the bomb' simultaneously invokes 90s slang popularized by EPMD and Phife Dawg while maintaining the destructive metaphor setup with Godzilla. 'Stick it to them' suggests both aggression and the 'sticking' of landing points in debate—a technique perfected in battle rap by artists like Loaded Lux."

        explanation: "The performative boredom ('yawn') channels Drake's dismissive attitude toward lesser competitors in tracks like 'Back to Back.' The claimed forgetfulness creates an appearance of effortless superiority similar to Floyd Mayweather's boxing persona that influenced Rick Ross's 'Idols Become Rivals.' 'Keep it movin'' echoes Eric B. & Rakim's philosophy of constant progression and innovation. The 'unimpressed' stance suggests high standards similar to Tech N9ne's critical approach to mainstream rap. This section's overall dismissive tone relates to the battle rap tradition exemplified by Murda Mook where psychological dominance is established through appearing unbothered."

        explanation: "The extended basketball metaphor connects to Jay-Z's 'Brooklyn's Finest' where hoops and hustling metaphors intertwine. 'In the net' works as both basketball scoring and internet/capturing imagery, showing linguistic versatility similar to Royce da 5'9\". 'Pressed' brilliantly functions as both basketball defensive pressure (like full-court press) and emotional distress, reminiscent of Freddie Gibbs' multilayered street terminology. 'Ball in your court' transitions the sports metaphor to tennis while maintaining the basketball connection, demonstrating the seamless metaphor-shifting technique mastered by Black Thought in The Roots' 'Things Fall Apart.' This sports imagery also connects to LeBron James's cultural significance in hip-hop as referenced by Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and J. Cole."

        ],
        explanation: "The swimming metaphor ('deep end') suggests both throwing someone unprepared into difficult situations and possibly Michael Phelps' dominance as a cultural reference point. The transition to direct confrontation through eye contact evokes the intense battle rap face-offs in leagues like URL and KOTD, while also suggesting the unflinching gaze described in 2Pac's more confrontational tracks. 'Til you realise' creates anticipatory tension similar to methodical storytelling in Slick Rick's narratives. The 'wait' concept establishes hierarchical positioning reminiscent of how Dr. Dre positioned himself as gatekeeper in the industry, making artists like Snoop Dogg and Eminem wait for his mentorship and guidance."

        explanation: "The repeated 'baby' address creates deliberate ambiguity between romantic and competitive contexts—a technique popularized by Andre 3000 in OutKast's 'Hey Ya' where seemingly playful language masks deeper meanings. 'Wait your turn' establishes clear power dynamics reminiscent of how Nicki Minaj positioned herself in 'Monster,' demanding respect while making others wait. The 'do or die' phrase invokes both the Chicago rap group and the high-stakes mentality of 50 Cent's early work where survival and success were presented as the only options. This duality between intimacy and competition reflects Lauryn Hill's exploration of complicated relationships in 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill' where personal and professional boundaries blur."

        explanation: "The central paradox of 'just words' while demonstrating verbal virtuosity connects to Common's philosophical approach in 'I Used to Love H.E.R.' where hip-hop's essence is questioned through the medium itself. 'Homegirl' creates conversational intimacy similar to how Missy Elliott addresses listeners directly, establishing both connection and authority. The repeated eye contact imagery suggests unflinching conviction reminiscent of DMX's intense delivery style where emotional and physical confrontation merge. This section develops tension between dismissing language's power while weaponizing it—a contradiction explored in Yasiin Bey's (formerly Mos Def) 'Mathematics' where statistical realities are presented as 'just numbers' yet carry profound significance."

        explanation: "The repetition technique here recalls DJ Khaled's signature phrase repetition, creating recognizable hooks through persistence. The continued power dynamic established through 'wait your turn' connects to industry hierarchies as discussed in Ice-T's critiques of music business structure. The 'baby' address maintains the dual meaning between romantic partner and competitive opponent, similar to how The Notorious B.I.G. often blurred these distinctions in tracks like 'I Got a Story to Tell.' The 'do or die' mentality reflects Chicago's South Side reality as documented by artists like Chief Keef and Chance the Rapper from opposing perspectives, suggesting Klense's awareness of regional hip-hop contexts."

        explanation: "The transition from hook to second verse uses seamless engineering reminiscent of Travis Scott's production style where boundaries between sections blur. 'Still in my mind' shifts focus to internal creative processes, similar to Nas' introspective approach in 'I Gave You Power.' The 'illest of lines' directly connects to Big L and Big Pun's technical prowess, while 'go viral' updates traditional boasting for the social media era, demonstrating contemporary awareness like Megan Thee Stallion. The extended salt metaphor ('brine') for causing irritation shows commitment to sustained imagery similar to MF DOOM's food references throughout 'MM..FOOD,' creating thematic consistency while demonstrating linguistic creativity."

        ],
        explanation: "The 'salty' continuation extends the brine metaphor while incorporating modern slang popularized through gaming culture and platforms like Twitch. The Halsey reference works multiple levels: directly naming the singer, creating wordplay on 'hell-see in Paris' (potentially referencing Jay-Z/Kanye's 'Ni**as in Paris'), and suggesting international presence. This triple-entendre technique mirrors Lil Wayne's approach to stacking meanings in series. 'Y'all'll' demonstrates phonetic compression skills similar to E-40's linguistic innovations. The proximity threat ('nearest to you') suggests both physical intimidation like DMX and intellectual outmaneuvering like Talib Kweli, creating multi-dimensional competitive positioning."

        ],
        explanation: "The 'too new' claim positions the artist beyond contemporary trends, similar to how André 3000 often describes being ahead of his time. The Blues Clues reference demonstrates cross-generational pop culture knowledge, connecting children's educational programming to hip-hop in the tradition of MF DOOM's cartoon samples. This creates nostalgic connection for millennial listeners while maintaining competitive edge. 'Joshin'' creates clever wordplay while 'nothin' to lose' references both 2Pac's fearless attitude and potentially Notorious B.I.G.'s 'Juicy' narrative of rising from nothing. The rhythmic breaking of 'no-thin'' demonstrates syllabic manipulation mastered by artists like Twista and Busta Rhymes, showing technical control over delivery."

        explanation: "The studio reference ('booth') connects to the tradition of DJ Premier production interludes where studio environments become part of the narrative. 'Foolproof' suggests both simplicity and technical reliability, qualities emphasized in Tyler, the Creator's production philosophy. The wordplay on 'losing it' brilliantly balances control and chaos similar to Eminem's persona in 'The Way I Am.' The rapid internal rhyme scheme ('proving/improvement/zooming') demonstrates technical virtuosity like Busta Rhymes' speed-rap sections, while the progress narrative connects to Kanye West's artistic evolution rhetoric throughout his discography. The overall confidence in technical ability reflects the production-conscious perspective of artists like J Dilla who emphasized mastery of equipment."

        explanation: "The 'groovin'' reference recalls A Tribe Called Quest's emphasis on feel and rhythm over technical showing-off. Self-admiration ('impressed by yours truly') updates Kanye West's self-awareness for a new generation while maintaining the tradition of Muhammad Ali's poetic self-promotion that influenced hip-hop's confidence. The audience-conscious statement about giving people 'what they want' shares DNA with Drake's commercial awareness while maintaining artistic integrity like J. Cole. The repetition of 'next' emphasizes future orientation similar to Future's construction of anticipation through ad-libs and hooks. This section balances commercial awareness with artistic integrity in the tradition of Jay-Z's 'The Blueprint.'"

        explanation: "The quality guarantee ('nothin' less') reflects the premium branding approach of artists like Rick Ross. The ingenious champagne/sham pain homophone creates dual meanings worthy of Lupe Fiasco's wordplay, suggesting both celebration and fake posturing. This may reference Jay-Z's Armand de Brignac ownership and broader hip-hop champagne culture dating to the Notorious B.I.G.'s 'Big Poppa.' 'Talking with chest' references aggressive posturing in the tradition of DMX while possibly alluding to the 'all chest no legs' criticism in gym culture. The staring contest metaphor demonstrates commitment to confrontation similar to Ice Cube's unflinching gaze in both music and film personas, while creating perfect transition back to the hook—demonstrating song structure mastery like Pharrell Williams."

        explanation: "The hook's return demonstrates structural mastery similar to Dr. Dre's production philosophy where repetition creates familiarity while subtly evolving. The direct confrontation through eye contact references both hip-hop battle culture's face-to-face tradition and the intimidation techniques documented in Sun Tzu's 'Art of War'—a text frequently referenced by Wu-Tang Clan. The waiting concept reinforces hierarchical positioning similar to how veteran artists like Snoop Dogg established generational authority. The hook's rhythmic construction shows influences from southern trap cadences pioneered by T.I. and Gucci Mane, while maintaining lyrical substance that connects to east coast traditions."

        explanation: "The intimate 'Baby' address draws from R&B crossover traditions pioneered by artists like Ja Rule and Nelly. The 'do or die' repetition emphasizes both commitment and the high-stakes mentality of Chicago's drill scene. The continued tension between relationship and competition recalls the complex dynamics in Rihanna and Eminem's 'Love the Way You Lie' where intimate and confrontational elements merge. The dismissive 'just words' line has now accumulated substantial ironic weight, creating philosophical depth similar to Kendrick Lamar's exploration of language in 'DAMN.' This phrase also connects to debates about artistic responsibility raised by Ice-T's 'Cop Killer' controversy and broader questions about whether lyrics constitute mere expression or actual threats/promises."

        explanation: "The 'I said' emphasis connects to hip-hop's oral tradition where repetition for emphasis has roots in African-American church traditions that influenced artists like Kirk Franklin and Chance the Rapper. The continued eye contact imagery connects to prison culture's stare-down intimidation techniques documented in 2Pac's writings on institutional power dynamics. The 'realise' suggests an awakening similar to consciousness movements in hip-hop pioneered by KRS-One and Public Enemy. These elements combine cultural resistance traditions with personal confrontation, similar to how N.W.A. balanced systemic critique with individual threats, creating layered meaning that operates on both personal and political levels."

The 'wait your turn' hierarchy connects to broader conversations about paying dues in hip-hop, as discussed in documentaries like 'The Art of Rap.' The relationship framing through 'Baby, you and I' creates emotional complexity beyond simple aggression, similar to how 2Pac balanced vulnerability and strength throughout his discography.

The direct address as 'homegirl' maintains the dual relationship/competition framing while suggesting familiarity in the tradition of Snoop Dogg's conversational style. The unflinching gaze imagery now carries accumulated weight from hip-hop's visual culture, from album covers like Ice Cube's 'AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted' to the intense close-ups in music videos directed by Hype Williams. This section demonstrates how repetition can build meaning rather than diminish it, a technique mastered by producers like Metro Boomin."

The 'do or die' ethos connects to both street code ethics documented in the works of Kool G Rap and the artistic commitment philosophy expressed in Rakim's 'Follow the Leader.' This closing sentiment encapsulates the track's sophisticated exploration of language's dual nature—limitation and transcendence—creating intellectual depth comparable to the philosophical questions raised in Yasiin Bey's 'Mathematics' or Talib Kweli's 'Reflection Eternal.' The final 'just words' leaves listeners with unresolved tension between dismissing language and celebrating it, a contradiction that mirrors hip-hop's broader cultural position between marginalization and cultural dominance."
