# New Track Premiere: 'Midnight Echoes'

I'm excited to share my latest single "Midnight Echoes" with you. This track represents a new direction in my sound, combining electronic elements with organic instruments to create something unique and engaging.

## About the Track

"Midnight Echoes" was born during a late-night studio session where I was experimenting with different synth textures and field recordings. The main melody came from a dream I had, which I quickly recorded on my phone upon waking.

- Vocal samples processed through granular synthesis

## Lyrics

```
Verse 1:
Through the static of the night
Digital dreams take flight
Echoes of a distant call
Breaking through the wall

Chorus:
Midnight echoes, calling me
Through the static, set me free
Digital waves across the sky
Time to say goodbye
```
