        Working on <strong>Some Of Ink</strong> was an incredible journey. This EP gave me the opportunity to revisit tracks from my 2021 release, <em>Son Of Ink</em>, and breathe new life into them. It was a chance to reflect on my growth as an artist and approach these songs with a fresh lens and perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process was both challenging and rewarding. Revisiting old tracks felt like reconnecting with an old friend—familiar yet different. I wanted to honor the original essence of these songs while exploring new creative directions. It was about finding the balance between nostalgia and innovation.
      </p>

      <h2>Why "Some Of Ink"?</h2>
      <p>
        The name <strong>Some Of Ink</strong> reflects the idea of revisiting a part of my past work. It’s not a complete reimagining but rather a curated selection of tracks that resonated deeply with me. Each song was chosen for its potential to evolve and tell a new story.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Expect</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Some Of Ink</strong> is a blend of the old and the new. Fans of <em>Son Of Ink</em> will recognize the core elements of the original tracks, but they’ll also notice fresh twists and surprises. From updated lyrics to remastered instrumentals, this EP truly felt like a celebration of evolution and creativity, especially after such a long period of silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m incredibly proud of how this project turned out, and I can’t wait for you to hear it. Whether you’re a longtime fan or new to my music, I hope <strong>Some Of Ink</strong> resonates with you and offers a glimpse into my journey as an artist.
