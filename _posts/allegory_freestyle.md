# New Track Premiere: 'Allegory (Freestyle)'
## Technical Details
- BPM: 84
- Key: C minor

I'm excited to share my latest freestyle, *Allegory (Freestyle)*.
This one-minute rap is a display of raw energy, sharp lyricism, and unfiltered expression. *Allegory (Freestyle)* is a punchy, high-intensity track that encapsulates a moment of lyrical prowess. Every bar carries weight, packed with meaning and layered wordplay.
I had so much fun working on this one. It's been ages since the last Klense song hit streaming and I thought, "What better way to come back into the spotlight than to give the people that braggadocio Klense sound?"

## Production Notes
The track features:
- Hard-hitting boom-bap drums
- Gritty, old-school hip-hop sampling
- Aggressive, rapid-fire delivery
- A raw, unfiltered mix to retain its freestyle essence
- An audio excerpt from a friend at the end. He was spittin' lowkey too 🔥

## Lyrics
```
Uh, I could show you the ropes
But I’m too busy bein’ me
On a phenomenal roll
This song here isn’t even deep

I just want you to know 
That as far as things go
If I never said it before
That I know I’m always the GOAT

And I’m back with the finest streak, freestylin’ these
Finally, I’m with the high elite
Why are we talkin’ ‘bout hirin’ me?
Irony? I’m at a higher peak

I was the one you would hide, and seek-
Out, and now when I ride a beat
How could you even ride with me?
I’m in the “Fiery” list and category

My life is an allegory of always lookin’ up
Better step right out of my territory 
My options were very borin’
I’d rather make music

Than listen to your generic story
Of how you made nothin’
And passed it off like you found your calling
I’m callin’ you out


I just took my first breath in that verse since that little shout, at the beginnin’
I’m binnin’ a rapper; an MC’s final chapter
Quit hirin’ ghostwriters
Your material’s Casper

(This… this is not planted in the house…
This is outside… this is the corridor
Unless Leon knows how to float

Bro thinks this is “IT”
But unless Leon knows how to float…

…It’s, it’s, it’s, yes…
Th- This is the… This is the…
The… The… The risk-to-reward ratio right here)
