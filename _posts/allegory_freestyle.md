# New Track Premiere: 'Allegory (Freestyle)'
## Technical Details
- BPM: 84
- Key: C minor

I'm excited to share my latest freestyle, *Allegory (Freestyle)*.
This one-minute rap is a display of raw energy, sharp lyricism, and unfiltered expression. *Allegory (Freestyle)* is a punchy, high-intensity track that encapsulates a moment of lyrical prowess. Every bar carries weight, packed with meaning and layered wordplay.
I had so much fun working on this one. It's been ages since the last Klense song hit streaming and I thought, "What better way to come back into the spotlight than to give the people that braggadocio Klense sound?"

## Production Notes
The track features:
- Hard-hitting boom-bap drums
- Gritty, old-school hip-hop sampling
- Aggressive, rapid-fire delivery
- A raw, unfiltered mix to retain its freestyle essence
- An audio excerpt from a friend at the end. He was spittin' lowkey too ðŸ”¥
