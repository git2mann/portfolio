> *What if the ideas you never finished were the most honest things you ever made?*

Welcome to **Half Thoughts**â€”a collection of demos, fragments, and sonic sketches that refused to stay buried in my hard drive. These aren't polished singles crafted for streaming algorithms. They're honest, raw, and beautifully incomplete. Some are loops that lived rent-free in my head for months. Others are verses or melodies that felt too personal to throw away, too real to perfect.

This is music for 1 AM creators, for overthinkers, for anyone who's ever started something beautiful and left it unfinishedâ€”not out of laziness, but because sometimes the fragment captures the feeling better than the full song ever could.

**Why free?** Because art should be accessible. Because some of you are broke students with incredible taste. Because I believe good music finds its way to the people who need it. Pay what you can, when you can. The music matters more than the money.

## What Lives Inside These 34 Minutes?

**16 tracks** that feel like flipping through someone's creative journalâ€”intimate, unguarded, sometimes messy, always honest. This collection blends:

- **Alternative rock** with teeth and texture
- **Jazz-tinged saxophone** that breathes warmth into chaos  
- **Hip-hop influenced rhythms** that hit different in the headphones
- **Ambient textures** for when words aren't enough

Each song is a fragment that somehow feels completeâ€”capturing those moments when your mind is everywhere and nowhere at once. No filler. No filter. Just 34 minutes of pure creative energy that doesn't apologize for being unfinished.

**The philosophy:** Sometimes the demo captures the lightning in a bottle that gets lost in the "professional" version. These tracks live in that sweet spot between idea and execution, where the emotion is still raw and the energy hasn't been polished away.

## Track-by-Track Journey

### **Opening Act: "The Evening Dispatch!"** *(2:05)*
Urgent, energetic, like breaking news from your subconscious. This is where we drop you into the worldâ€”no gentle introduction, just pure creative adrenaline. Based on my own writings and thoughts on the state of the world in this day and age.

### **"Saxophone"** *(2:05)*
Jazz meets alternative in a way that shouldn't work but absolutely does. Sometimes you need brass to cut through the noise of your own thoughts.

### **The Oze Duality** *(4:28 total)*
"Oze II" and "Oze" exist as complementary fragmentsâ€”same energy, different expressions. Think of them as musical siblings who finished each other's sentences. Oze III exists but was unironically too unfinished to make it onto the record. I wonder why they're called Oze...

### **"Wish Ya Told Me!"** *(1:33)*
Raw, emotional, and over before you're ready. Some feelings can't be stretched into full songsâ€”they burn bright and brief.

### **"Intermission IV"** *(2:11)*
A breath of ambient calm in the beautiful mess. Fourth in a series because sometimes you need multiple attempts to find the right silence.

### **The Heart: "You Are The Reason"** *(1:53)*
Direct, unflinching, personal. This one hits different because it was never meant to be heard by anyone else.

### **"Blue Salmon" & "Deglupta"** *(2:55 total)*
Playful meets contemplative. Nature references because sometimes human words aren't enough to describe the feeling.

### **The Waiting Game** *(1:36)*
"Kept You Waiting" captures that anxious energy of anticipationâ€”musical ADHD that somehow becomes a vibe.

### **"Karl Draisack"** *(2:37)*
Say Karl Draisack three times really quickly; Karl Draisack... Karl Draisack... Cul-De-Sac.

### **"Forbo" & "Garble Surmount"** *(4:30 total)*
These tracks live in their own space.

### **"Impromptu"** *(3:05)*
The longest track, the most developed, but still beautifully unfinished. Sometimes you know when to stop before you ruin the magic.

### **"Addis Abeba"** *(2:42)*
Geographic inspiration meets emotional geography. Every place has a sound if you listen close enough.

### **Closing: "Abide by Klense"** *(2:03)*
A statement, a philosophy, a closing door that might also be an opening window.

## âœ¨ Interactive: Your Half Thoughts Matter

**A conversation starter.**

**Drop your thoughts below:**
- Which fragment hit you the hardest?
- What's your favorite unfinished creative project?
- If you could hear a full version of any track, which one?
- Share your own "half thought"â€”musical or otherwise

**For the creators:** Found a loop that inspired you? Made a remix? Sampled something? [Hit me up](/contact)â€”I love seeing what these fragments become in other hands.

**For the dreamers:** Sometimes the most honest art lives in the space between finished and unfinished. What are you leaving beautifully incomplete?

## ðŸ’¬ Behind the Fragments: Artist's Notes

> "Half Thoughts started as digital hoarding. I had hundreds of voice memos, abandoned Logic and GarageBand sessions, saxophone riffs recorded on my phone at 2 AM. Most artists would call this 'scraps.' I started calling it 'honesty.'
> 
> This collection is a gift to everyone who's followed my journey so far, but it's also a statement: not everything needs to be perfect to be meaningful. Some of these tracks are literally half-finished. Others are complete but feel like fragments. All of them are real.
> 
> I hope you find something here that resonates, inspires, or just makes you nod your head. More than that, I hope it gives you permission to share your own unfinished genius with the world."
> 
> **â€” Klense, July 2025**

### **Technical Notes for the Curious:**
- Recorded primarily in Logic Pro and GarageBand with a healthy dose of iPhone voice memos
- Some tracks intentionally left unmastered to preserve the raw energy
- Album art created during a particularly inspired afternoon with digital brushes and too much coffee
