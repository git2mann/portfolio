    <h1><em>I’m a Musician Who Happens to Be African</em></h1>
    <h2>Contradictions, memories and melodies.</h2>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h3>The Quiet Expectation</h3>
    <p>There’s a quiet expectation that lingers the moment I say I’m from Kenya.<br />
    Not spoken, but heard.<br />
    Not demanded, but assumed.<br />
    That I should sound a certain way.<br />
    Look a certain way.<br />
    Carry my culture like a costume, always on display.</p>

    <p>That my music should echo tradition.<br />
    That it should wear identity like beadwork.<br />
    That it should walk barefoot through the past,<br />
    chant in ancestral tones,<br />
    and carry a drum under its arm wherever it goes.</p>

    <h3>The Weight of Expectations</h3>
    <p>I’ve asked myself what it means to be “authentically African.”<br />
    More than once.<br />
    Late at night.<br />
    Early in the morning.<br />
    In the stillness of my creative rituals;<br />
    when I’m not chasing aesthetic,<br />
    not chasing identity,<br />
    just chasing something <em>true</em>.</p>

    <h3>What Raised Me</h3>
    <p>The truth is, I don’t write songs in my native language.<br />
    Not out of shame,<br />
    but because I never knew it deeply enough to turn it into melody.</p>

    <p>I wasn’t raised on folktales or oral histories.<br />
    I was raised on internet cafes, early 2000's discographies, and playlists that jumped from Kanye to ambient electronica.</p>

    <p>I’ve heard more trap hi-hats than ngoma drum beats.<br />
    I’ve seen more TikToks than tribal dances.<br />
    I see a T-shirt more often than I do a kitenge.<br />
    Increasingly, the most African thing in my day is the dust on my shoes.</p>

    <p>Dust from cracked sidewalks, imported vehicles and midday errands.<br />
    Not a drumbeat,<br />
    Not a proverb,<br />
    Not a ceremonial cloth.<br />
    Just the trace of a land I’m walking through, not performing for.</p>

    <h3>The Ancestors I Never Met</h3>
    <p>Sometimes I wonder what my ancestors would have wanted.<br />
    Would they be disappointed I don’t sing in their tongue?<br />
    Would they feel erased by my silence?</p>

    <p>I don’t know.<br />
    I may never know.</p>

    <p>But if there is any thread that runs from them to me,<br />
    it is not language, not sound, not ritual.<br />
    It is the act of creating from where I am.<br />
    Of making something from the fragments I inherit,<br />
    and choosing to make it my own.</p>

    <h3>Not a Representation. A Reflection.</h3>
    <p>I don’t make music to prove where I’m from.<br />
    I make music to process who I am.<br />
    Because in a world that tries to narrate you before you’ve said a word,<br />
    art becomes the only honest interruption.</p>

    <p>And who I am is not easily packaged.<br />
    I am as much <strong>Leon</strong> as I am <strong>Nduati</strong>.<br />
    As much <strong>Stephen</strong> as I am <strong>Kimemia</strong>.<br />
    Split between names that carry lineage<br />
    and names that carry modernity.<br />
    Between what was given to me<br />
    and what I chose.<br />
    And I let that contradiction breathe in every note.</p>

    <h3>I Don’t Fit the Script</h3>
    <p>Yes, I’m Kenyan. Yes, I’m African.<br />
    But that is the context, not the product.</p>

    <p>I am not here to decorate my sound with borrowed symbols for export.<br />
    I am not here to fit into the global template of what an “African artist” should sound like.<br />
    I am not here to satisfy a hunger for the exotic.</p>

    <p>I am not trying to bring “Africa to the world.”<br />
    I am trying to bring <em>myself</em> to the mic,<br />
    and leave something honest behind.</p>

    <h3>This Moment Is Enough</h3>
    <p>I want to build a catalogue that sounds like this moment.<br />
    Not the past.<br />
    Not the expectation.<br />
    Just the real, unglamorous, uncurated present.<br />
    Modern. Dislocated. Self-aware.<br />
    Rooted not in tradition, but in <strong>choice</strong>.</p>

    <p>My music is not a performance of identity.<br />
    It is the result of standing still long enough<br />
    to hear my own voice<br />
    beneath the noise of what others expect it to be.</p>

    <h3>Just Klense</h3>
    <p>I am not here to carry the weight of a continent.<br />
    I am not here to apologize for the parts of me that don’t translate.<br />
    I am not here to explain why my art sounds the way it does.</p>

    <p>I am <strong>Klense</strong>.<br />
    A musician who happens to be African.<br />
    I don’t represent the culture.<br />
    I reflect my experience.<br />
    And sometimes, that’s the most authentic thing you can do.</p>

    <p>But as much as I am simply me,<br />
    I like to think my ancestors still live on<br />
    in the way I trip over my L’s and R’s on vocal takes<br />
    that sit quietly on my hard drive.<br />
    They show up in the background hiss,<br />
    in the second-guessing,<br />
    in the parts I leave in because they feel <em>real</em>.<br />
    Not in grand tributes,<br />
    but in the mess I make trying to get it right.</p>
