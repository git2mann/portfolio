# Behind the Scenes: Making of 'Roast' Music Video

Creating a music video is an intricate process that combines various art forms - music, cinematography, choreography, and storytelling. In this post, I'll take you through the journey of creating the music video for "Roast."

## The Concept

The initial concept came from wanting to create something that matched the raw energy of the track. We decided to go with a minimalist approach, focusing on intense lighting and dynamic camera movements to capture the essence of the song.

## Pre-Production

Before hitting record, we spent weeks planning:
- Location scouting
- Storyboarding
- Lighting design
- Shot list creation
- Team assembly

## The Shoot

We shot the entire video over two intense days. Some interesting facts about the production:
- Used a combination of LED panels and practical lights
- Shot on RED Komodo
- Utilized a wireless gimbal for fluid movement
- Captured everything in 6K for post-production flexibility

## Post-Production

The editing process took about three weeks, including:
- Color grading
- Visual effects
- Sound design
- Final adjustments

## Final Thoughts

This project pushed our creative boundaries and resulted in something we're all proud of. The video has received positive feedback for its innovative approach and technical execution.
